# *Tasks to accomplish*
1. **Exploratory analysis** - perform a thorough exploratory analysis of the data, understanding the distribution of words and relationship between the words in the corpora. 

2. **Understand frequencies of words and word pairs** - build figures and tables to understand variation in the frequencies of words and word pairs in the data.

# *Questions to consider*
1. Some words are more frequent than others - what are the distributions of word frequencies? 
2. What are the frequencies of 2-grams and 3-grams in the dataset? 
3. How many unique words do you need in a frequency sorted dictionary to cover 50% of all word instances in the language? 90%? 
4. How do you evaluate how many of the words come from foreign languages? 
5. Can you think of a way to increase the coverage -- identifying words that may not be in the corpora or using a smaller number of words in the dictionary to cover the same number of phrases?
